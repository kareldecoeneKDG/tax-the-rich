            <h1>Tax The Rich</h1>

            <p id="pIntroduction">
            In America, a system has recently been introduced to tax the rich more. However, the republicans want to expand this system and tax the rich even more. This can be done in several ways, but I prefer taxation on wealth.<br><br>
            To find out to what extent this is feasible and has an effect on society I have done research and this website is to show my proof of concept to the interested public.
